# Altamont-Hacktoberfest-Python-2019

Welcome to the Altamont Hacktoberfest for Python. If you are a student at Altamont, feel free to contribute to the repo. This repo is a HTML page that is designed as a way for people to see Python code examples and result of running the Python code. Read through the example that is shown there. You will need to make a copy of the example and add your code below the example. Look for the comments in the HTML code that explains what Python code you will need to change and make your own.

If you see any code syntax errors or output errors by others, feel free to fix them and send in a PR!

Happy coding!
